# Cassandra + Spark + Zeppelin

This is a repository for a docker-compose script that creates two Docker containers - one with a Zeppelin instance and the other one with a Cassandra node

## Usage
Make sure to have a valid Docker and docker-compose Installation, running on a 64-bit system (either directly on a mac or Linux machine, or on a VirtualBox - or similar - VM running a 64-bit guest; this means that you'll end up running Docker inside a VM, this is fine for testing and learning purposes). To install/configure Docker and/or Docker Compose follow the steps described at https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ and https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/ (this is for Ubuntu based Linux systems)
